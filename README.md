Ping Pong Game in Python
This is a simple implementation of the classic Ping Pong game using Python and the Pygame library.

Getting Started

How to Play
The game is a two-player game where the players use paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The objective of the game is to score points by making the ball go past the other player's paddle.

You can control the left paddle using the W and S keys, and the right paddle using the up and down arrow keys.

The game ends when one player reaches a certain number of points or when the ball goes off the screen.
